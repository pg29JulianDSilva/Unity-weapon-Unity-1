This are the key files for the project, however, there is attached also a pacage exportable for unity. 

There is also in a sepparated bkac called "External Exports" a package manager with:
The scene
The materials
The Prefabs
The Scripts

Which if they are imported to the assets folder in a new 3Duniversal unity file it will work as well.
